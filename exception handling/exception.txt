Exception will cause three things :
    1.Abnormal termination of a program
    2.Informal/UnFriendly information to the end user
    3.Improper shutdown of resources

We need to handle exceptions in order for this three not to happen in out application.
Exception is a class .There are inbuilt exceptions we can use in our application as 
well as we can define an exception(user defined exception).

Syntax :
    try :
        Code that might raise an exception
    except ZeroDivisionError:


If the code in the try block raises an exception then control will go to the
except block.
Try and except can also have a else block which will be executed if the exception is 
noy raised.And finally block it will be executed no matter if there is a exception or not
