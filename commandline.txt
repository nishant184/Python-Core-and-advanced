Command line arguments are those arguments that are when our python 
programs runs for eg,python,myprogram.py.

The main uses of command line programs could be passing in a  file location
which we can dynamically locate  when the program is running instead
of hardcoding allocation you can pass in a command line argument for 
allocation.

Similarly for database connection url passed in using a command line argument
or it could be a remote ip address all this values can be passed by 
command line argument

This values are passed through a list called argv,this list will contain all
the arguments that are passed in,and this list is inside the sys module in
python,to access the elements we will use sys.argv,while sys is the module
and argv is the list which contains all the arguments
