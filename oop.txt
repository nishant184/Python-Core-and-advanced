#OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOP)

This world is full of objects that work with each other or communicate with each other
for eg,There are two person objects named by Nishant and Sumit,
this objects will have traits or properties like age,weight and qualification
and behavior like look() and speak() to each other.
The object in this world will have Identity/name,properties/variables,functionality/behavior.
Its use to replicate real world problems with object oriented programmming

The 4 key object oriented principles are 
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism


#CLASSES
Classes allows us to use our own data type ie. user defined data type
it acts as a blue print for our objects
A class represents a :
                    variable(blue print)
                    methods 
for a particular object is defined
